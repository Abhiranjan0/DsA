  hashing -> improvement over direct accessstable
        by a hash function.

        best of search,insert ,delelte -> O(1) on average

        not useful for -> finding closet value , sorted date prefix searching

        it is 2nd most used datastructure(after array).

        * Hashing is an improvement over Direct Access Table.
         The idea is to use a hash function that converts a given phone number or any other key to a smaller number and uses
          the small number as an index in a table called a hash table

    application of hashing:-
      dictionaries
      database indexing
      cryptography
      chaes
      symbol tables in compilers/interpreters
      routers
      getting data from databases
      -many more
